#Used the following lines to format the date and remove NAs from the dataset:

#Plot these population data over time with the following code:

  xlab("Numeric Date") + ylab("Density Individuals")+
  geom_line(data=data, aes(Date, D.mendotae), color="black", alpha = 0.7, size=1)+

# Export this plot to have on hand for reference in the next section of the assignment (and upload with your script).

# (1) - Which species is most likely to be r-selected prey and which its primary predator? (2 pts)
#The species most likely to be r-selected prey is Bythotrephes and the primary predator is D. mendotae.

# What is one relationship the third species MIGHT have to the first two? (2 pts)
#The third species (Limnocalanus) might be the prey of the primary predator species (D. mendotae). It may also be a predator towards Bythotrephes.

#Now copy/paste in the Lotka-Volterra function, plotting script, and load the "deSolve" package from the tutorial:
LotVmod <- function (Time, State, Pars) {
  with(as.list(c(State, Pars)), {
    dx = x*(alpha - beta*y)
    dy = -y*(gamma - delta*x)
    return(list(c(dx, dy)))
  })
}

Pars <- c(alpha = 2, beta = 0.5, gamma = .2, delta = .6) #This is the line we will change
State <- c(x = 10, y = 10)#For now keep this the same.
Time <- seq(0, 100, by = 1)#For now keep this the same.
out <- as.data.frame(ode(func = LotVmod, y = State, parms = Pars, times = Time))

library(deSolve)

# (2) - What do alpha, beta, gamma, and delta represent in this function? (4 pts)
#Alpha represents the rate of prey population growth.
#Beta represents the rate of predation.
#Gamma represents the rate of prey consumption as population stability.
#Delta represents the rate of prey consumption as predator die-off.

# (3) - By only changing values for alpha, beta, gamma, and/or delta
# change the default parameters of the L-V model to best approximate the relationship between Limncalanus and D.mendotae, assuming both plots are on the same time scale.
# What are the changes you've made to alpha, beta, gamma, and delta from the default values; and what do they say in a relative sense about the plankton data? (4 pts)
# Are there other parameter changes that could have created the same end result? (2 pts)
# Export your final L-V plot with a legend that includes the appropriate genus and/or species name as if the model results were the real plankton data, 
# and upload with your script. (hint - remember which one is the predator and which is the prey)
